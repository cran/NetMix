# NetMix
NetMix: Dynamic Mixed-Membership Network Regression Model. Variational EM estimation of mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel for networks, incorporating node-level predictors of mixed-membership vectors, as well as dyad-level predictors. For networks observed over time, the model defines a hidden Markov process that allows the effects of node-level predictors to evolve in discrete, historical periods. In addition, the package offers a variety of utilities for exploring results of estimation, including tools for conducting posterior predictive checks of goodness-of-fit and several plotting functions.
