\description{
The function generates a variety of plots that serve as posterior predictive checks on the goodness of fit of a fitted \code{mmsbm} object.
}
\details{
Goodness of fit of network models has typically been established by evaluating how the structural characteristics of predicted networks 
compare to those of the observed network. When estimated in a Bayesian framework, this approach is equivalent to 
conducting posterior preditive checks on these structural quantities of interest. When \code{new.data.dyad} and/or \code{new.data.monad} are
passed that are different from those used in estimation, this is equivalent to conducting posterior predictive checks out-of-sample. 

The set of structural features used to determine goodness of fit is somewhat arbitrary, and chosen mostly to incorporate various 
first order, second order, and (to the extent possible) third-order characteristics of the network. "Geodesics" focuses on the distribution over 
observed and predicted geodesic distances between nodes; "Indegree" and "Outdegree" focuses on the distribution over incoming and outgoing connections 
per node; "3-motifs" focus on a distribution over possible connectivity patterns between triads (i.e. the triadic census); "Dyad Shared Partners" focuses on the distribution
over the number of shared partners between any two dayds; "Edge Shared Partners" is similarly defined, but w.r.t. edges, rather than dyads; and finally
"Incoming K-stars" focuses on a frequency distribution over stars with k=1,... spokes. 

Obtaining samples of the last three structural features can be very computationally expensive, and is discouraged on networks with more than 50
nodes.
